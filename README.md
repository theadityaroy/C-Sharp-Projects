# Simple Calculator
### Objective:
Create a console-based calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

## Key Concepts:
- Basic C# syntax
- Methods for each operation (e.g., Add, Subtract)
- Input/output using Console.ReadLine() and Console.WriteLine()
- Handling exceptions, like division by zero

2. Bank Account Management
## Objective:
Create a simple bank account management system where users can create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance.

## Key Concepts:
- Classes and objects (e.g., BankAccount)
- Encapsulation (private fields for balance, public methods for actions)
- Constructor to initialize account details
- Exception handling for invalid operations (e.g., withdrawing more than the balance)

3. Library Management System
## Objective:
Build a simple library management system where users can add new books, issue books, and return books.

## Key Concepts:
- Multiple classes (Book, Library, Member)
- Inheritance (e.g., LibraryItem as a base class)
- Collection handling (e.g., List<Book>)
- Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

4. Inventory Management System
## Objective:
Develop an inventory management system that tracks products, their quantities, and allows users to add, remove, or update products.

## Key Concepts:
- CRUD operations
- Collections (Dictionary or List)
- Method overloading for adding different types of products
- Error handling and input validation

5. Simple Chat Application (Console-Based)
## Objective:
Build a console-based chat application where users can send and receive messages.

## Key Concepts:
- Networking: Using TcpListener and TcpClient to create the server and client.
- Multithreading: Using threads to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
- Input/Output: Handling user input and displaying messages in the console.
